<h2>Objective: Build Simon Game using Vanilla JavaScript</h2>
<p>Being a newbie to programming, I am trying to build as many things as possible to help advance my JavaScript skillset.
As I was looking for ideas I came across the FreeCodeCamp <a href="https://learn.freecodecamp.org/coding-interview-prep/take-home-projects/" target='_blank'>"Take Home Projects"</a>,
and decided to give the Simon Game a Go!</p>
